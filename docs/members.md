# Members
Quadratic-labs DAO uses a role-based membership system. Members are assigned roles, allowing them to vote on proposals of certain types.

## Roles
There are 2 roles to date:

  1. Administrator: responsible for onboarding new members and whitelisting assets.
  1. Governor: responsible for the governance of the assets.

## Delegation
Members can deleguate their assets to another account. This allows them for example to have a dedicated wallet for DAO voting activity separated from their financial wallet.
