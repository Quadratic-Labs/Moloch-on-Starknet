# Proposals
There are several types of proposals that can be submitted to the DAO, each being secured by role-based privileges. To a proposal is associated a list of actions that needs to be executed in the given order were the proposal to pass. 

## Types of proposals

  1. Onboard (administrator only): propose a list of new members to the DAO and the conditions of admission (number of shares and loots) 
  1. GuildKick (governor only): propose a list of members to eject from the DAO. This protects the organisation from abusing members. Note that all proposals on which a targeted member has voted before being guildkicked will be settled before actual removal from the DAO. In the meanwhile, the member is jailed and cannot vote on any new proposals.
  1. ApproveToken (administrator only): propose a list of assets/tokens that can be traded by the organisation.
  1. RemoveToken (administrator only): propose a list of assets/tokens to be removed from the whitelist.
  1. Order (governor only): propose a list of financial orders to be executed by the organisation.
